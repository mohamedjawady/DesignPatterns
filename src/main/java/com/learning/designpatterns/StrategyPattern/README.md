## Strategy Design (Behavioral)
The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables you to encapsulate different algorithms or strategies and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows you to select a specific algorithm at runtime based on the current context or requirement.  

The pattern consists of three main components:  
1. Context: The object that is responsible for creating and maintaining a reference to the chosen strategy object.  
2. Strategy: The interface or abstract class that defines the operations that all concrete strategies must implement.  
3. Concrete Strategy: The class that implements a specific algorithm or strategy defined in the strategy interface or abstract class.  
The basic idea behind this pattern is to create a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as a separate class, and make them interchangeable. By doing so, the client can switch between algorithms at runtime without affecting the client's code. This approach promotes code reusability, enhances flexibility, and improves maintainability.  
Here is an example implementation of the Strategy Design Pattern in Java:  

```java
interface Strategy {
    public void executeStrategy();
}

class Context {
    private Strategy strategy;
    
    public Context(Strategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    
    public void executeStrategy() {
        strategy.executeStrategy();
    }
}

class ConcreteStrategyA implements Strategy {
    public void executeStrategy() {
        System.out.println("Executing strategy A");
    }
}

class ConcreteStrategyB implements Strategy {
    public void executeStrategy() {
        System.out.println("Executing strategy B");
    }
}

```  
In this example, we have a Context class that holds a reference to a Strategy object.  
The Context object calls the executeStrategy() method on the Strategy object to perform the desired operation.   
The ConcreteStrategyA and ConcreteStrategyB classes implement the Strategy interface and provide their own implementation of the executeStrategy() method.  

Here is how you can use the Strategy Design Pattern:  
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Context context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyA());
    context.executeStrategy(); // Output: Executing strategy A
    
    context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyB());
    context.executeStrategy(); // Output: Executing strategy B
}

```  
In this example, we create a Context object with ConcreteStrategyA and ConcreteStrategyB objects and call the executeStrategy() method to execute the desired algorithm.
